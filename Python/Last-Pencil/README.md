This is a simple Python game for two players, John and Jack, where they take turns removing pencils from a pile. The objective is to be the last player to remove a pencil. Here's a breakdown of how the game works:

1. The game starts by asking the user how many pencils they would like to use. The input is validated to ensure it's a positive integer.

2. The user is then asked who will be the first player: John or Jack. If the input is not one of these two names, the user is prompted to choose between John and Jack.

3. The game begins, and a pile of pencils is represented by vertical bars ("|"). The players take turns removing pencils from the pile.

4. Jack follows a simple strategy: He always tries to leave 4 pencils for his opponent, ensuring he wins on the next turn if possible.

5. John is given the flexibility to choose how many pencils to take, but he's limited to 1, 2, or 3 pencils. If John tries to take more pencils than are available, he's prompted to try again.

6. The game continues until there are no more pencils in the pile.

7. The game announces the winner, which is the player who didn't have to make the last move.

Here's an example of what the game's interaction might look like:

```
How many pencils would you like to use:
10
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
John
||||||||||
John's turn:
2
|||||||||
Jack's turn:
2
||||||||
John's turn:
3
||||
Jack's turn:
3
||
John's turn:
2
|
Jack's turn:
1
Jack won!
```

In this example, John and Jack take turns removing pencils from the pile, and Jack wins the game.
