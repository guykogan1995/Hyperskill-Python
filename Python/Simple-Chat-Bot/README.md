2. Name Reminder: The bot asks for your name and compliments it.
3. Age Guess: The bot attempts to guess your age based on remainders.
4. Counting Challenge: The bot demonstrates its counting abilities.
5. Programming Knowledge Test: The bot tests your knowledge with a multiple-choice question.
6. Conclusion: The bot congratulates you and bids you farewell.

## Usage

To use this interactive learning script, follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste the script into your Python environment.

2. Execute the script.

3. The script will guide you through each step of the interactive learning process, prompting you to provide answers and engage in conversations.

4. Follow the bot's instructions and provide your input as requested. Answer questions, provide remainders, and test your programming knowledge.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```bash
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.

Please, remind me your name.
John
What a great name you have, John!

Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5, and 7.
1
2
1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!

Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
5
0 !
1 !
2 !
3 !
4 !
5 !

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
2
Completed, have a nice day!

Congratulations, have a nice day!
```

In this example, the bot engages in conversation, asks questions, and provides feedback based on your responses.
