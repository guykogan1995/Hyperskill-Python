4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python simple_calculator.py
   ```

5. You will be prompted to enter a mathematical equation in the format `number operator number`. For example: `5 + 3` or `6 / 2`.

6. After calculating the result, you can choose to store it in memory for later use.

7. The calculator also provides options to continue calculations or exit.

## Commands

The script supports the following commands:

- Input a mathematical equation in the format `number operator number`.
- Store the result in memory and recall it.
- Continue with additional calculations.
- Exit the calculator.

## Input Validation

The calculator checks for valid input, ensuring that:

- Numbers and operators are provided in the correct format.
